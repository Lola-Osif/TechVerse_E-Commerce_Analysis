The average customer spend rose from the lowest ($212) among all regions in 2019 to the highest($317) from 2020 onwards, consistently exceeding the global average through 2022.

## Loyalty Program

- Sales: Non-loyalty members generated more sales revenue from 2019 to 2020 reaching a peak of $788K in September 2020. However, sales from loyalty customers outperformed non-loyalty customers in 2021 and 2022 with a maximum revenue of 508K in December 2021. Although the total sales amount from non-loyalty customers exceed loyalty cusomers , loyalty sales share has risen from 11% to 41% over the four-year period, indicating stronger retention compared to non-loyalty customers.


- AOV: Loyal customers spend increased by 93% from march to Septembr 2019  and remained fairly consistent ($200-$250) despite fluctuations in sales in 2021 and 2022. Contrastly, non-loyalty members show a volume driven trend with spikes corresponding to sales.
- Both loyalty and Non-loyalty sales  and AOV fall sharply in late (Oct- Dec) 2022, which may reflect broader market changes to pre-pandemic levels
- Purchase platform: While most customers place their orders through the website, 54% of orders made on the mobile app come from loyalty program members.
- Repeated purchases: Of all registered customers, 70,000 made a single purchase while 4,600 placed multiple orders. Notably, 4,500 of these repeat purchases were made by non-loyalty customers. This gap highlights that the current loyalty program is not influencing repeat purchases.


## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the company should implement the following recommendations 
### Target high-performing products and optimise product portfolio
- Leverage Apple’s strong product portfolio to build closer partnerships with distributors, secure volume discounts and expand the range and model of apple devices, particulatly iphones, to ensure a resilient supply chain and steady stock with competitive pricing. This approach will enhance the company's profit margins and delivers greater value and choice  to customers.
- Assess the underperformance of Bose headphones to determine whether to replace, reprice, or discontinue the product.

### Implement Promotional strategies
-  Incorporate sales promotions into established seasonal patterns to maximize revenue opportunities. For example, end-of-year sales bundles in November and December and introduce summer holiday promotions around mid-year. Customer profiles and seasonal demand trends should be further investigated to ensure these campaigns are tailored to the customers needs and deliver stronger conversion rates.
- Additionally, implement cross-sell strategies by recommending complementary products, bundling high-demand items with accessories and providing service support packages to increase the revenue per customer.

### Accelerate Growth in APAC region:
- APAC’s high customer spend and operational efficiency makes it a high-potential market. Marketing efforts and localized promotions should be scaled up starting with the region’s leading players, Japan and India, supported by expanded laptop inventory/ models.

- Evaluating industry benchmarks and investing in logistics to position faster, more reliable delivery as a competitive differentiator. This is particularly relevant given APAC’s status as a prominent manufacturing hub for premium electronic devices, enabling cost-efficient supply chains and quicker time-to-market.

### Augument and monitor Loyalty Program
- With a growing share of loyalty members and an average order value (AOV) steady at around $250, the loyalty program should be continued, though it should be monitored closely and subjected to regular cost–benefit analysis over the next few years.
- The program’s offerings should be enhanced to provide greater rewards that align with the products most valued by repeat customers.
